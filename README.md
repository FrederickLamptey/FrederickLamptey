## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack developer and a Senior DevOps Engineer. I am originally from Accra, Ghana but currently live in Hillsborough, New Jersey. I am from a humble background and from a family of eight. I am the only son to my parents, and have five junior sisters.
I attended one of the best high schools in my country called St.Augustine's college in Cape-coast. I grew up in a town called Teshie in the Greater Accra region of Ghana.
